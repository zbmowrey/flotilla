# flotilla

Definition: (n) a fleet of ships or boats. 

## What

A docker-compose file built to let you quickly stand up a usenet stack. 

## Why

Because I can't find an equivalent that I like. The ones I have found are out of date or incomplete in some way. I'll take the best ideas from those and add my own personal touches. 

## Where

Right here. 

## When

When I find time. This is a personal project, not a job. Deadlines are expressly forbidden. 

## How

With my own two hands. And maybe yours.
